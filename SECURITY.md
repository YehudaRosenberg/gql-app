## Introduction

As this is primarily a learning and demonstration project focused on secure API practices, I appreciate any responsible disclosure of potential security vulnerabilities found.


## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please report suspected security vulnerabilities privately using GitHub's Private Vulnerability Reporting feature.**

**Avoid creating public GitHub Issues or Pull Requests for security concerns.**

**How to Report:**

2.  Click on "Report a vulnerability".
3.  Fill out the form with details about the vulnerability.

**What to Include:**

To help me understand and address the issue quickly, please include:

* A clear description of the vulnerability and its potential impact.
* Detailed steps to reproduce the vulnerability (e.g., specific GraphQL queries/mutations, arguments, required setup).
* The component or file(s) you believe are affected.
* Any suggested mitigation (optional).

**Response Time:**

I will do my best to work on the best fix and notify you when it's available on the `main` branch.

Thank you for helping keep this learning project secure through responsible disclosure!
